LawLiet is a lawbot, basically an OpenAI's GPT4o mini model, finetuned specifically to assist the user in all aspects of Indian legal documents.
The dataset used was extracted from multiple articles and then processed.
The backend is built using flask.
The frontend is designed simply using HTML and Javascript.

To get this project on your PC, do the following:
1. Copy this URL https://github.com/AliRizvi433/LawLiet.git
2. Install the Github Desktop Environment on your PC.
3.  Specify the Directory you want to clone the repo to.
4.  TADA!

P.S: I have removed the hardlined API Key from the code, you can simply add yours.
TO only run the website, you only have to add the API to app.py
however if you plan on further finetuning, you might want to add the KEY in fineTuner.py and fineTuneMonitor.py aswell.

IF NOTHING MAKES SENSE, JUST YOUTUBE THIS SHIT!
